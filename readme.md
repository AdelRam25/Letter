My time at Gomycode has been a game-changer. I started with zero coding experience I didn’t even know how to print "Hello World" in HTML. Now I’ve learned frontend development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, and Next.js, as well as backend basics like Node.js and MongoDB. I’ve also gained proficiency in essential tools like Git and DevTools.

Beyond technical skills, I’ve significantly improved my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills. Looking back, I can confidently say that joining Gomycode was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and I don’t regret it for a second!

I’m ready to take the next step in my career and start working as a developer. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in the tech world.

A big thank you to my instructor, Karim Ouadhi, for always being there to guide and support us. Your patience and dedication made this journey possible.

And last but not least, a huge shoutout to Hamid our legendary classmate. We’ll never forget the jokes and laughs we had at your expense. You may not be real, but the fun memories definitely are! Thanks for being the unofficial mascot of our course. :D
